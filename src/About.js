        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> I first took interest to graphic design back in 2013. Since then, I've ventured into website design & development. I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering with a minor
                in Mathematics at the University of Nevada, Reno.
        </p>
        <p>I expect to graduate in May of 2019. I'm actively
        seeking employment as a junior developer, and sharpening my skills with freelance work in the meantime.
        Contact or hire me!</p>
