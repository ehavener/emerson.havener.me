    <p>
      Hi, My name is Emerson. I&apos;m a student
      currently attending the University of
      Nevada, Reno. Over the past year, I&apos;ve
      spent my spare time learning how to develop
      & design websites.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&apos;m currently pursuing a B.S. in
      Computer Science & Engineering with a minor
      in Mathematics. I expect to graduate in May
      of 2019.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Hiring?</strong> I&apos;m looking to
      take on an internship or part time role this
      summer.
    </p>
