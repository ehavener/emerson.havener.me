    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I first took interest to graphic design back in 2013. Since then,
      I&apos;ve ventured into website design & development. I&apos;m currently
      pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering with a minor
                in Mathematics at the University of Nevada, Reno.
    </p>
    <p>I expect to graduate in May of 2019. I&apos;m actively
        seeking employment as a junior developer, and sharpening
        my skills with freelance work in the meantime.
        Contact or hire me!
